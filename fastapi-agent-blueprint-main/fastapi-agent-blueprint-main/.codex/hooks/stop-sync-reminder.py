"""Stop hook (Codex side) — sync-reminder + Phase 3 verify-first segment.

Single Stop event output (IC-2): all advisories are collected into a list of
segments and emitted as one ``{"systemMessage": "<segments joined by \\n\\n>"}``
JSON line. Empty list = no output.

Phase 3 (#122 / R0.1) reinforcement: the verify-first import is performed
inside the same ``try`` block that calls ``should_remind`` so an ImportError
or any module-level failure never crashes the existing sync-reminder
behaviour (HC-3.6 fail-open).
