## Governor-Changing PR (delete this section if not applicable)

This section is **required** if your PR is *governor-changing* per [`docs/ai/shared/governor-paths.md`](../docs/ai/shared/governor-paths.md) (Tier A / B / C minus exclusions).
Otherwise delete the entire section.

Source of truth: [`AGENTS.md` § Default Coding Flow](../AGENTS.md#default-coding-flow) + [`docs/ai/shared/governor-paths.md`](../docs/ai/shared/governor-paths.md) + [`docs/ai/shared/governor-review-log/README.md`](../docs/ai/shared/governor-review-log/README.md).

### Triggered files

- [ ] At least one file in `changed_files` matches a Tier A / B / C path in `governor-paths.md`, and no full-set exclusion applies.

### Cross-tool review

- [ ] Codex `gpt-5.5 --sandbox read-only` review completed at least once (plan stage and/or implementation stage).
- [ ] All R-points addressed or explicitly deferred with rationale.
- [ ] Final Verdict captured (`merge-ready` / `minor fixes recommended` / `block merge`).

### Self-application proof

- [ ] `/review-architecture` (or its manual equivalent) output captured for the changed surface — `Findings` / `Drift Candidates` / `Sync Required`.
- [ ] `/sync-guidelines` (or its manual equivalent) output captured — `AUTO-FIX` / `REVIEW` / `Remaining`.

### Review trail artifact

- [ ] `docs/ai/shared/governor-review-log/pr-{NNN}-{slug}.md` added (or existing entry extended) with: Summary, Review Rounds, Inherited Constraints, Self-Application Proof.
- [ ] `governor-review-log/README.md` Index table updated.
- [ ] If this PR creates follow-up issues, each follow-up issue body links the new log entry under "Inherited Review Constraints".

### Doc-only escape hygiene

- [ ] If this PR is doc-only, confirm the changes do **not** touch policy / harness docs as listed in [`governor-paths.md`](../docs/ai/shared/governor-paths.md) Tier A. Touching those files disqualifies the doc-only auto-escape — see [`target-operating-model.md` §3](../docs/ai/shared/target-operating-model.md).

### Phase context (Phase 2~5 of #117 only)

- [ ] PR description links the relevant section of [`migration-strategy.md` §1](../docs/ai/shared/migration-strategy.md).
- [ ] Inherited Constraints (IC-1 ~ IC-9 in [`governor-review-log/pr-125-...`](../docs/ai/shared/governor-review-log/pr-125-hybrid-harness-target-architecture.md)) reviewed; any phase-specific tightening recorded in this PR's log entry.
