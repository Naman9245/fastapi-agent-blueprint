# Governor Review Log

> Living archive of cross-tool review trails for **governor-changing PRs**.
> Source of truth: ADR 045 §Self-Application Recovery + AGENTS.md § Default Coding Flow §Cross-Tool Review.

## Purpose

Issue #117 introduced a hybrid local process governor (ADR 045). The review trail that produced ADR 045 — three rounds of Codex `gpt-5.5 --sandbox read-only` review — is *itself* a load-bearing piece of context that subsequent governor-changing PRs (Phase 2~5 of [migration-strategy.md](../migration-strategy.md), and any future shared-rule edit) must inherit to avoid re-discovering the same blind spots.

This directory exists so that the trail is not buried in PR descriptions.

## Scope (which PRs need a log entry)

A PR is **governor-changing** — and therefore must add an entry here — if its `changed_files` intersects any glob in [`governor-paths.md`](../governor-paths.md) (Tier A / B / C minus Exclusions).

For non-governor-changing PRs (regular feature, bug fix, refactor inside `src/`), no entry is required. The `governor-paths.md` file itself defines the Exclusions (e.g. log-only backfill PRs that extend an existing entry).

## File naming

```
pr-{NNN}-{short-slug}.md
```

Example: `pr-125-hybrid-harness-target-architecture.md`.

The number is the GitHub PR number. The slug is a kebab-cased short title (≤ 60 chars).

## Entry shape

Each entry must contain at minimum:

1. **Summary** — one-paragraph PR description, link to GitHub PR.
2. **Review rounds** — ordered list of Codex review rounds (or equivalent cross-tool review). Each round captures: target, prompt focus, surfaced points (R1, R2, ...), Final Verdict.
3. **Inherited constraints** — the R-points and lessons that future governor-changing PRs must respect. This is the part that is link-cited from follow-up issues.
4. **Self-application proof** — explicit invocation of `/review-architecture` and `/sync-guidelines` on the PR's own changed surface, with their canonical outputs (Findings / Drift Candidates / Sync Required / Remaining). Required so that the governor proves it followed itself.

## Retention

Entries are kept for the lifetime of the repository. The matrix and the migration-strategy document rely on this directory as a permanent reference.

If a future ADR consolidates or rotates entries (e.g. annual archive subdirectories), that decision is itself a governor-changing PR that must add its own entry here.

## Drift discipline

`docs/ai/shared/drift-checklist.md` §1D verifies that every governor-changing PR merged into `main` has a corresponding log entry. `/sync-guidelines` consumes that row.

## Cross-Tool Review Prompt Template

Use the template below as a starting point when invoking `codex exec -m gpt-5.5 --sandbox read-only "<prompt>"`. Adapt the bullets to the specific phase or change set; do not include sections that do not apply.

```
**Cross-tool review of <PR / plan / change-set name>** (read-only). markdown only; no file modification, no git commands.

## Context
- Repo: fastapi-agent-blueprint
- PR / branch: <link or branch name>
- Issue link: <#NNN>
- ADR(s) governing this change: <e.g. ADR 045>
- Inherited constraints carried from prior PRs: <link governor-review-log entries; cite IC-N tags>
- Round number: <1 plan / 2 implementation / 3 readiness / N>

## What you are reviewing
- <one-paragraph summary of the change set>
- Key files: <list 3~5 critical files>

## Review angles (per item: OK / 보완 필요 / 재고 필요 / 머지 차단)

1. Self-coherence — does this PR follow the governor it modifies?
2. Path-list / trigger glob consistency — do AGENTS.md / TOM / migration / drift-checklist / PR template all link `governor-paths.md` correctly without re-declaring?
3. Hand-off readiness — can a new contributor with cold context start the next phase from issue body + governor-review-log + ADR?
4. Cross-tool symmetry — Claude vs Codex hook surfaces; `apply_patch` blind spot (R7); NFKC normalisation (R3); precedence rules (R1).
5. Cascade risk — what new false-negatives or false-positives does this PR introduce?
6. Friction vs governance balance — issue #117 Non-Goals (heavy ceremony / false-positive blocking).
7. New gaps not seen in earlier rounds — what does fresh eyes catch?

## Output format

Each review angle: assessment + 1~3 paragraph analysis citing file:line where possible. Then:
- **Final Verdict**: merge-ready / minor fixes recommended / still needs reinforcement / block merge
- **Top recommendations** (priority order)
- **Open questions** for the user
```

The prompt is a starting point; phase-specific reviews (Phase 2 token parser, Phase 3 verify adapter, Phase 4 completion gate, Phase 5 shared module) extend it with phase-specific angles.
